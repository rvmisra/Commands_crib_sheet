Crib sheet:
if and statement excel.. to do 2 variable searches

=IF(AND(A2>1421858,A2<1423249),"Yes","")

String count in excel, for a range:

=COUNTIF(G1:G69,"Yes")

To find and print every nth line of a file
sed -n '0~4p' somefile
line 4
line 8
$
0~4 means select every 4th line, beginning at line 0. 
Line 0 has nothing, so the first printed line is line 4.
-n means only explicitly printed lines are included in output.


Soooooo example for cat and farahs data visulisation:
using the bam files:
samtools depth -q <input.bam> > <output_depthx.txt>
Then to print out every 1000th line (see example above)
sed -n '0~1000p' <output_depthx.txt> > <output_depthx_every1000thline.txt>

To count number of entries in a list per string.  But print the search string once e.g.

sort db_id.txt | uniq -c > dbid_count.txt

output filename is:
dbid_count.txt
File content:
2 apple
1 pear
